# Ukraine-Choropleth
This short and simple repository contains a geospatial data visualization of percentage of people with Ukrainian as their native (or first) language according to 2001 census. A customized choropleth was developed with <code>folium</code> library. The map is interactive and allows the user to do basic actions: zoom in-out, choose layers, display tooltips.
